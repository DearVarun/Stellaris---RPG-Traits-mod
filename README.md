Stellaris mod: RPG Traits

INSTALLATION:
1. Download the repository.
2. Unzip.
3. Put the files into your Stellaris/mods folder (any other mods you have should be there as well).
4.  Activate ONE of the mods in your launcher, NOT BOTH. Just one. Yes. One. Less than two. You get it.
    Normal is normal
    HEAVY is extra stuff
    If you have literally zero idea what that means; pick normal
   
5. Play the game!

6. (optionally) Install the LITE or ULTRALITE version, by copying the .txt file inside into the events folder of either the normal or HEAVY version and then OVERWRITE. If you don't know what this does then don't.

Suggestions are welcome in the subreddit /r/stellarisrpg

If you wish to contribute, think of a good trait/event/whatever and send me the code in whatever way you like. 
(Make sure to mention it in the suggestions thread first, to avoid spending effort on something that won't be implemented)

Cheers,
LuxArdens
