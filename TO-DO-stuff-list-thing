Pre-Release

- All the traits need icons assigned to them, probably the base game icons first

- New icons for the new traits. For extreme versions a pallete swap will do; others will require a new icon.

- Make up new, interesting and ambigious traits like "Silicoids" or "Gigantic" with appropiately extreme stats and localization

- add various opinion modifiers for traits

- Find a way to incorporate more advanced modifiers (such as fire rate) into traits 
(a start has been made using events. the on_actions thingie can also be used for this apparently)



Future stuff:

- MOAHR extreme, game-changing traits.

- Make a repeatable trait point tech for late-game



Probably impossible:

- Find a way to reduce the amount of traits random AI races get to a more reasonable number, WITHOUT lowering the hard cap in the defines. 
(events/scripts maybe?)
