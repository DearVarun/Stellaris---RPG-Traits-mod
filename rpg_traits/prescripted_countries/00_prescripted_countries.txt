Though conventional science has disproved such an outlandish theory, the presence of Ether Drake remains in and around the planet and home system of the Draconis does imply a link between the two species in some way. This has instilled in the Draconis a strong violent but curious sense of discovery, and, as such, they are willing to go to any lengths to find, protect, and preserve the last of the Drakes, their guardians and legacy."

Though slavery is officially outlawed by the federation the Kylar have gotten by claiming that they only enslave \"criminals\" and \"undesirables\", yet in reality, the Kylar still perform numerous slave raids, or employ raiders such as the Perricullis, who capture citizens of other nations for service and sale by the Kylar. Though this has angered some, the threat of the Kylar and their slave armies has kept many naysayers in check"
